Project
-------

  The DBplus was created in November, 2011 as an auxiliary tool for a
  WEB framework project. In the same month the DBplus project was
  created and all related code was migrated. The purpose is to create
  an API interface initially to two database clients (MySQL and
  PostgreSQL).

  After five years working with an API that created a lot of manual
  work, the decision to create a new API was to think in a design for
  ease use and flexibility for different database clients.

MySQL notes
-----------

While using MySQL in this API, you must remember that the type of the
column in MySQL database will be mapped to a specific type in
C++. This is important when you are retrieving a data after a SELECT
command. Check out the following table to see what column is mapped to
what type.

 ----------------------------------------------
| MySQL Column Type | C++ Type                 |
 ----------------------------------------------
| TINYINT           | uint8_t                  |
| SMALLINT          | short                    |
| MEDIUMINT         | uint32_t                 |
| INT               | long                     |
| BIGINT            | long long                |
| FLOAT             | float                    |
| DOUBLE            | double                   |
| DATE              | boost::gregorian::date   |
| NEWDATE           | boost::gregorian::date   |
| DATETIME          | boost::posix_time::ptime |
| YEAR              | int                      |
| VARCHAR           | std::string              |
| TINYBLOB          | dbplus::Binary           |
| BLOB              | dbplus::Binary           |
| MEDIUMBLOB        | dbplus::Binary           |
| LONGBLOB          | dbplus::Binary           |
 ----------------------------------------------

The types BIT, BOOLEAN, DECIMAL, TIMESTAMP, TIME, ENUM and SET are not
mapped yet to any of the C++ types.

PostgreSQL Notes
----------------

While using PostgreSQL in this API, you must remember that the type of
the column in PostgreSQL database will be mapped to a specific type in
C++. This is important when you are retrieving a data after a SELECT
command. Check out the following table to see what column is mapped to
what type.

 ----------------------------------------------
| Oid Type          | C++ Type                 |
 ----------------------------------------------
| _int4             | long                     |
| _int8             | long long                |
| _timestamp        | boost::posix_time::ptime |
 ----------------------------------------------

All other types are not mapped yet.
